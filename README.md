◈ The Initial Diagnostic Inquiry
To initiate a 7-Point Structural Integrity Audit, the following diagnostic vectors must be addressed. These inquiries are designed to expose systemic entropy and verify alignment with the Logos.

Mission Drift: Where is the current system architecture most misaligned with its founding Logos?

Extractive Dependencies: Which third-party nodes currently hold unencrypted or privileged access to user Sovereignty?

Fracture Points: What is the specific data-throughput threshold where Logical Cohesion currently fails?

Legacy Entropy: What percentage of engineering energy is lost to maintaining debt rather than hardening the Future-Proof Vessel?

Autonomy Check: Is the system architected for Human Sovereignty (Zero-Knowledge) or for algorithmic capture?
