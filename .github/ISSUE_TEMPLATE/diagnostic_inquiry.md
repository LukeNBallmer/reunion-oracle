### ◈ Architectural Identification
**System Name:**
**Primary Mission:**

### ◈ Structural Integrity Vectors
Please provide high-fidelity data for the following vectors to determine alignment with the Logos:

1. **Mission Drift:** Describe the current misalignment between your system architecture and its founding mission.
2. **Dependency Audit:** List the primary third-party hooks or centralized nodes currently integrated into your vessel.
3. **Fracture Point Analysis:** At what specific throughput threshold does your system's logical cohesion currently fail?
4. **Legacy Entropy:** What percentage of your engineering energy is diverted to technical debt rather than hardening?
5. **Sovereignty Check:** Does your current architecture prioritize Human Sovereignty (Zero-Knowledge) or algorithmic capture?
